Algorithm:
1. First, we need to import os
    a) Professor gave us two other files with data
2. Our first function is called:
    a) def checkFIle()
    b) This allows us to check a file name, to make sure the user inputs a correct file name
    c) We then need to use a while not
    d) Also need to loop the function, if the user does not input the correct file name
    e) Lastly, we need to return the file name
3. The second function:
    a) def maxProfit ()
    b) This function will give us the max profit for what movie made the maximum profit
    c) We need to open the file name for reading and for writing
    d) We then need an input from the user : "Please enter the name of a file to write to: "
    e) To calculate the profit:  profit = boxOffice - budget
    f) If the file name is not found, we output to the user:
        i) File does not exist
4. Next, we need to call the main function
    a) The function is:
        i)  filename = checkFile()
             maxProfit(filename)
             wFile(filename)
5. Lastly, we need to put main() at the bottom of our code
